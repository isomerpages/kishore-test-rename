part of your CPF monies and will be subjected to CPF withdrawal rules.

institutions under the MediSave Scheme.
<br>
<br>MediSave can also be used to pay for day surgeries and approved outpatient

<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How will I know if the Assurance Package (AP) Cash, AP Seniors' Bonus and/or AP MediSave has been credited to my bank/CPF account?</strong> 
<br>You will receive a message in the inbox of your Singpass app after payment
has been made. Please turn on your notifications for the app so that you
will not miss any alerts and messages.
<br>
<br>As the Singpass app is the default mode of notification, you are strongly
encouraged to download the Singpass app to receive Government related information
via this secured channel. Please ensure that your app is downloaded from
the official app stores (e.g. App store, Play Store or Huawei AppGallery)
and check that the app is developed by “Government Technology Agency".
<br>
<br>If you do not have the Singpass app, an SMS (with no web links) will be
sent to your Singpass-registered mobile number.
<br>
<br>To update your mobile number, please log in to your Singpass account at
the <a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main/" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Singpass website</u></a>.

<li>
<p><strong>Do I qualify for Assurance Package (AP) Cash and/or AP Seniors' Bonus if my Assessable Income (AI) is unavailable, but I meet all other criteria?</strong> 
<br>You may check if your AI is available by visiting <a href="https://www.govpayouts.gov.sg/cds/main/login" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">iras.gov.sg</a> [log
in to myTax Portal using your Singpass &gt; Notices/Letters &gt; Individual,
select Year of Assessment]. If your AI is unavailable because you have
not filed your tax returns, you may wish to first contact IRAS at 1800
356 8300 to file your income tax returns and thereafter log in to the
<a href="https://www.govpayouts.gov.sg/cds/main/login" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>e-services</u> 
</a>with your Singpass to reach out to us.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One of the eligibility criteria for the 2024 Assurance Package (AP) Seniors' Bonus is that the Income Earned in 2021 (Assessable Income (AI) for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2022) must not exceed $34,000. Why is the AI for YA2022 (instead of YA2023) used?</strong> 
<br>For Singaporeans to receive their 2024 AP Seniors' Bonus by February 2024,
we assess the eligibility based on Income Earned for 2021 (AI for YA2022)
because this is the latest tax assessment available.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why is Annual Value (AV) used instead of flat type?</strong> 
<br>AV is currently used as a proxy for wealth and family support. It is a
reasonable and best available proxy to assess the financial resources available
to the individual, including from immediate family members who reside with
the individual.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why is Annual Value (AV) used for Assurance Package (AP) Seniors' Bonus but not for AP Cash?</strong> 
<br>Our social support schemes are generally means-tested to ensure support
is targeted to help Singaporeans with greater needs. For AP Seniors' Bonus,
the approach of using both AV and AI is to enable us to better target the
support to those who are in need of greater help.
<br>
<br>For AP Cash, the benefits are meant for all adult Singaporeans to cushion
the impact of the GST increase. Lower-income Singaporeans and those who
do not own more than one property will receive higher cash benefits.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do I qualify for the Assurance Package (AP) Seniors' Bonus if the Annual Value (AV) of my residence is unavailable, but I meet all other criteria?</strong> 
<br>AV of the preceding year is used to determine eligibility for AP Seniors’
Bonus in the current year.
<br>
<br>If you have not received AP Seniors’ Bonus as your place of residence
is a new property where AV is not yet available at the point of determining
the allotment for the AP Seniors’ Bonus, you may log in to the <a href="https://www.govpayouts.gov.sg/cds/main/login" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>e-services</u></a> with
your Singpass to update us when the AV of your residence is available.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will the 2024 increase in Annual Value (AV) impact my eligibility for the 2024 Assurance Package (AP) Seniors’ Bonus?</strong> 
<br>Your eligibility for social support schemes in 2024 will not be affected
by your 2024 AV. 2023 AV will be used to determine your scheme eligibility
in 2024.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How much will I receive if I stay in a rented property?</strong> 
<br>The amount of 2024 Assurance Package (AP) Seniors' Bonus you receive depends
on the Annual Value (AV) of your place of residence as stated on your NRIC
as at 31 July 2023, regardless of whether you own or rent the property.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If I own more than one property, will I be eligible for Assurance Package (AP) benefits?</strong> 
<br>Those who own more than one property will be eligible for AP Cash but
not the AP Seniors' Bonus. Such properties may include shophouses, private
residential properties or non-residential properties such as commercial
or industrial properties.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I own more than one property, but I earn a very low income and am in financial difficulty. Can I get my Assurance Package (AP) Seniors’ Bonus?</strong> 
<br>We may consider your request on a case-by-case basis. You may log in to
the <a href="https://www.govpayouts.gov.sg/cds/main/login" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>e-services</u></a> with
your Singpass to inform us of your circumstances and appeal for the AP
Seniors’ Bonus with the supporting documents.
<br>
<br>If you require further assistance, you may approach any Social Service
Office (SSO) within your vicinity who may be able to advise you on the
available assistance based on your situation and provide you with the necessary
assistance. You may wish to visit the <a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/sso/" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>SSO website</u></a> to

<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I am residing overseas. Am I eligible for Assurance Package (AP) Cash, AP Seniors' Bonus and/or AP MediSave?</strong> 
<br>The AP benefits are meant to cushion the impact of the GST rate increase
for Singaporeans residing in Singapore. Therefore, you are not eligible
for these benefits if you are residing overseas.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the beneficiary passes away before the payment of the Assurance Package (AP) Cash and/or AP Seniors' Bonus is made, will he/she still qualify?</strong> 
<br>No. The AP Cash and/or AP Seniors' Bonus is only paid out to Singapore
citizens who are alive.</p>

<p><strong>One of the eligibility criteria for the 2024 Assurance Package (AP) Seniors' Bonus is that the Income Earned in 2021 (Assessable Income (AI) for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2022) must not exceed $34,000. Why is the AI for YA2022 (instead of YA2023) used?</strong> 
<br>For Singaporeans to receive their 2024 AP Seniors' Bonus by February 2024,
we assess the eligibility based on Income Earned for 2021 (AI for YA2022)
because this is the latest tax assessment available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why is Annual Value (AV) used instead of flat type?</strong> 
<br>AV is currently used as a proxy for wealth and family support. It is a
reasonable and best available proxy to assess the financial resources available
to the individual, including from immediate family members who reside with
the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why is Annual Value (AV) used for Assurance Package (AP) Seniors' Bonus but not for AP Cash?</strong> 
<br>Our social support schemes are generally means-tested to ensure support
is targeted to help Singaporeans with greater needs. For AP Seniors' Bonus,
the approach of using both AV and AI is to enable us to better target the
support to those who are in need of greater help.
<br>
<br>For AP Cash, the benefits are meant for all adult Singaporeans to cushion
the impact of the GST increase. Lower-income Singaporeans and those who
do not own more than one property will receive higher cash benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do I qualify for the Assurance Package (AP) Seniors' Bonus if the Annual Value (AV) of my residence is unavailable, but I meet all other criteria?</strong> 
<br>AV of the preceding year is used to determine eligibility for AP Seniors’
Bonus in the current year.
<br>
<br>If you have not received AP Seniors’ Bonus as your place of residence
is a new property where AV is not yet available at the point of determining
the allotment for the AP Seniors’ Bonus, you may log in to the <a href="https://www.govpayouts.gov.sg/cds/main/login" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>e-services</u></a> with
your Singpass to update us when the AV of your residence is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will the 2024 increase in Annual Value (AV) impact my eligibility for the 2024 Assurance Package (AP) Seniors’ Bonus?</strong> 
<br>Your eligibility for social support schemes in 2024 will not be affected
by your 2024 AV. 2023 AV will be used to determine your scheme eligibility
in 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How much will I receive if I stay in a rented property?</strong> 
<br>The amount of 2024 Assurance Package (AP) Seniors' Bonus you receive depends
on the Annual Value (AV) of your place of residence as stated on your NRIC
as at 31 July 2023, regardless of whether you own or rent the property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If I own more than one property, will I be eligible for Assurance Package (AP) benefits?</strong> 
<br>Those who own more than one property will be eligible for AP Cash but
not the AP Seniors' Bonus. Such properties may include shophouses, private
residential properties or non-residential properties such as commercial
or industrial properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I own more than one property, but I earn a very low income and am in financial difficulty. Can I get my Assurance Package (AP) Seniors’ Bonus?</strong> 
<br>We may consider your request on a case-by-case basis. You may log in to
the <a href="https://www.govpayouts.gov.sg/cds/main/login" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>e-services</u></a> with
your Singpass to inform us of your circumstances and appeal for the AP
Seniors’ Bonus with the supporting documents.
<br>
<br>If you require further assistance, you may approach any Social Service
Office (SSO) within your vicinity who may be able to advise you on the
available assistance based on your situation and provide you with the necessary
assistance. You may wish to visit the <a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/sso/" class="hyperlink" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>SSO website</u></a> to
locate the nearest SSO to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I am residing overseas. Am I eligible for Assurance Package (AP) Cash, AP Seniors' Bonus and/or AP MediSave?</strong> 
<br>The AP benefits are meant to cushion the impact of the GST rate increase
for Singaporeans residing in Singapore. Therefore, you are not eligible
for these benefits if you are residing overseas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the beneficiary passes away before the payment of the Assurance Package (AP) Cash and/or AP Seniors' Bonus is made, will he/she still qualify?</strong> 
<br>No. The AP Cash and/or AP Seniors' Bonus is only paid out to Singapore
citizens who are alive.</p>
